# Compound Component Pattern

Spark is adopting the compound component pattern for all its components.

This pattern is particularly effective for complex UI components that have multiple related parts.

It is a powerful React pattern that allows you to create flexible, composable components with a clear and intuitive API. It's particularly effective for complex UI components that have multiple related parts.

## What is the Compound Component Pattern?

Compound components are a set of components that work together to form a cohesive unit. Instead of passing all configuration through props to a single component, you compose the component by combining multiple sub-components.

## The Problem with Monolithic Components

Traditional monolithic components often suffer from several issues:

- **Prop Drilling**: All configuration must be passed through a single component, leading to long prop lists
- **Limited Flexibility**: Components are rigid and difficult to customize without extensive prop combinations
- **Poor Readability**: Complex prop objects make it hard to understand what the component will render
- **Type Complexity**: Single large TypeScript interfaces become unwieldy and hard to maintain
- **Over-Engineering**: Components try to handle too many use cases, becoming bloated and fragile

## Benefits

- **Flexible Composition**: Components can be arranged and customized in any order
- **Clear API**: The component structure is self-documenting and intuitive
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each sub-component has a single responsibility with its own props and TypeScript types
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Sub-components can be used independently or in different combinations
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Better IntelliSense and type safety
- **Type Safety**: Each sub-component has its own TypeScript interface, providing better type checking and autocomplete

## Example: Popover Component

The Popover component in Spark demonstrates the compound component pattern perfectly:

```tsx
<Popover>
  <Popover.Trigger asChild>
    <Button>Trigger popover</Button>
  </Popover.Trigger>
  <Popover.Portal>
    <Popover.Content>
      <Popover.Header>Title</Popover.Header>
      <p>Content goes here</p>
      <Popover.Arrow />
      <Popover.CloseButton aria-label="Close" />
    </Popover.Content>
  </Popover.Portal>
</Popover>
```

### Component Anatomy

- **`Popover`**: The root component that provides context and manages state
- **`Popover.Trigger`**: The element that opens the popover
- **`Popover.Portal`**: Handles rendering the popover outside the normal DOM hierarchy
- **`Popover.Content`**: The actual popover content container
- **`Popover.Header`**: Optional header section
- **`Popover.Arrow`**: Visual indicator pointing to the trigger
- **`Popover.CloseButton`**: Optional close button

## Why This Pattern Works

The compound component pattern makes complex interactions feel natural and declarative. Each piece has a clear purpose, and developers can easily understand how to compose them together. The pattern scales well as components become more complex, maintaining clarity and flexibility throughout.

## Warnings

### Don't Split Compound Components Across Files

<Callout kind="warning">
  While compound components are composed of multiple sub-components, they should **never** be split across separate files.
</Callout>

 Here's why:

- **Context Dependency**: Sub-components rely on shared context from the root component
- **Import Complexity**: Developers would need to import multiple files for a single component
- **Breaking Changes**: Changes to one sub-component could break others without clear indication
- **Bundle Size**: Multiple files can lead to larger bundle sizes due to separate chunks
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Related logic becomes scattered, making debugging and updates difficult

**Always keep all sub-components of a compound component in the same file** to maintain cohesion and ensure they work together seamlessly.

### Example: The Dangers of Splitting

Here's what could go wrong if you split a compound component across files:

#### 1. Context Issues and Missing Provider

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG: Consumer imports parts in different files
// Header.tsx
import { Popover, PopoverTrigger } from '@spark/components'

export const Header = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <Popover>
        <PopoverTrigger>Menu</PopoverTrigger>
        {/* Missing PopoverContent - will not work by itself (Single Responsibility Principle is broken) */}
      </Popover>
    </header>
  )
}

// Sidebar.tsx  
import { PopoverContent } from '@spark/components'

export const Sidebar = () => {
  return (
    <aside>
      {/* This will crash because PopoverContext is not available */}
      <PopoverContent>Menu items</PopoverContent>
    </aside>
  )
}
```

#### 2. Maintenance Overhead

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG: Consumer spreads compound parts across multiple files
// UserProfile.tsx
import { Popover, PopoverTrigger } from '@spark/components'

export const UserProfile = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Popover>
        <PopoverTrigger>Profile</PopoverTrigger>
        {/* PopoverContent is in another file - hard to maintain */}
      </Popover>
    </div>
  )
}

// UserProfileContent.tsx
import { PopoverContent } from '@spark/components'

export const UserProfileContent = () => {
  return (
    <PopoverContent>
      <div>User info</div>
      <div>Settings</div>
      {/* If Popover API changes, this file needs updates */}
    </PopoverContent>
  )
}

// If Popover API changes, you need to update:
// - UserProfile.tsx (imports and usage)
// - UserProfileContent.tsx (imports and usage)
// - Any other files using Popover parts...

// Testing becomes complex:
// UserProfileContent.test.tsx
import { render } from '@testing-library/react'
import { UserProfileContent } from './UserProfileContent'

test('UserProfileContent renders correctly', () => {
  // ❌ This will fail because PopoverContent needs Popover context
  render(<UserProfileContent />) // Error: PopoverContext is not available
  
  // ❌ Need complex mock or wrapper
  render(
    <Popover>
      <UserProfileContent />
    </Popover>
  ) // Works but tests the wrong thing - testing Popover, not UserProfileContent
})
```

**vs.**

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT: Keep compound components together
// UserProfile.tsx
import { Popover } from '@spark/components'

export const UserProfile = () => {
  return (
    <Popover>
      <Popover.Trigger>Profile</Popover.Trigger>
      <Popover.Content>
        <div>User info</div>
        <div>Settings</div>
      </Popover.Content>
    </Popover>
  )
}
```
