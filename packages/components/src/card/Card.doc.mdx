# Card

A card is a generic container with multiple design and intent options. It is non-interactive by default but can be turned into either a link or a button.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Default} />

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/components
```

## Anatomy

```js
import { Card } from '@spark-ui/components/card'

export default () => (
  <Card>
    <Card.Backdrop />
    <Card.Content>
      {/* Your content here */}
    </Card.Content>
  </Card>
);
```

The Card component consists of three main parts:

- **Card**: The root container that provides the card's styling and context
- **Card.Backdrop**: An optional gradient effect on the top of the card
- **Card.Content**: The content container with proper padding and spacing

## API Reference

### Card

Contains all the parts of a card.

<ArgTypes of={Card} />

### _.Backdrop

A gradient effect on the top of the card, to highlight it.

<ArgTypes of={Card.Backdrop} />

### _.Content

Contains the content of the card.

<ArgTypes of={Card.Content} />


## Examples

### Backdrop

The `Card.Backdrop` component is used to create a gradient effect on the top of the card.

Set the `animation` prop to `slideRight` to animate the backdrop gradient (more animation options could be added in the future).

<Canvas of={CardStories.Backdrop} />


### Design and Intent

See all possible combinations of designs and intents in the table below.

- Use `design` prop to set the different look and feels of a card.
- Use `intent` prop to set the color intent of a card.

<Canvas of={CardStories.DesignAndIntentTable} />

### Inset Content

Pass the `inset` prop on `Card.Content` to remove the default padding.

It gives you more control over the content inside the card and its layout.

<Canvas of={CardStories.InsetContent} />

## Advanced Examples

### Link

Use the `render` prop so that the card renders as the element you pass (e.g. `render={<a href="..." />}`).
In this example, the card is rendered as a link.

This polymorphic behaviour can be used with any type of HTML element, but the following might be more common: `div, article, section, aside, button, a, form, li, nav`

<Callout kind="warning">
  If you do decide to change the underlying element type, it is your responsibility to ensure it
  remains accessible and functional. In the case of Tooltip.Trigger for example, it must be a
  focusable element that can respond to pointer and keyboard events. If you were to switch it to a
  div, it would no longer be accessible.
</Callout>

<Canvas of={CardStories.Link} />

### LinkBox

In case you wish to have interactive elements inside the card WHILE the card itself is a link, you can use the `LinkBox` component.

It will keep the HTML valid and accessible (as it is forbidden to have nested links, but `LinkBox` is a wrapper that allows it).

<Canvas of={CardStories.WithLinkBox} />
