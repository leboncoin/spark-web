# Card

A card is a generic container with multiple design and intent options. It is non-interactive by default but can be turned into either a link or a button.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Default} />

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/components
```

## Anatomy

```js
import { Card } from '@spark-ui/components/card'

export default () => (
  <Card>
    <Card.Backdrop />
    <Card.Content>
      {/* Your content here */}
    </Card.Content>
  </Card>
);
```

The Card component consists of three main parts:

- **Card**: The root container that provides the card's styling and context
- **Card.Backdrop**: An optional gradient effect on the top of the card
- **Card.Content**: The content container with proper padding and spacing

## Examples

### Backdrop

The `Card.Backdrop` component is used to create a gradient effect on the top of the card.

Set the `animation` prop to `slideRight` to animate the backdrop gradient (more animation options could be added in the future).

<Canvas of={CardStories.Backdrop} />


### Design and Intent

See all possible combinations of designs and intents in the table below.

- Use `design` prop to set the different look and feels of a card.
- Use `intent` prop to set the color intent of a card.

<Canvas of={CardStories.DesignAndIntentTable} />

### Inset Content

Pass the `inset` prop on `Card.Content` to remove the default padding.

It gives you more control over the content inside the card and its layout.

<Canvas of={CardStories.InsetContent} />

### With Gradient

The `withGradient` prop adds gradient backgrounds to cards while preserving good contrast.

**Filled design**: Uses color stops and gradient logic optimized for solid color backgrounds.
The gradient maintains the original color intensity while adding visual depth.

**Tinted design**: Uses different color stops and gradient logic specifically designed for 
container backgrounds. This ensures the gradient preserves the subtle, tinted appearance 
while maintaining excellent readability and contrast.

Use tailwind classes to:
- customize the orientation of the gradient (ex: `bg-linear-to-tl`)
- customize the start/end color stops (ex: `from-main to-accent`)

## Advanced Examples

### Link

Use `asChild` so that the card takes the html tag and props of its direct child element.
In this example, if you need your card to be a link.

This polymorphic behaviour can be used with any type of HTML element, but the following might be more common: `div, article, section, aside, button, a, form, li, nav`

<Callout kind="warning">
  If you do decide to change the underlying element type, it is your responsibility to ensure it
  remains accessible and functional. In the case of Tooltip.Trigger for example, it must be a
  focusable element that can respond to pointer and keyboard events. If you were to switch it to a
  div, it would no longer be accessible.
</Callout>

<Canvas of={CardStories.Link} />

### LinkBox

In case you wish to have interactive elements inside the card WHILE the card itself is a link, you can use the `LinkBox` component.

It will keep the HTML valid and accessible (as it is forbidden to have nested links, but `LinkBox` is a wrapper that allows it).
