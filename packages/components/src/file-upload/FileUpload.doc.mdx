# FileUpload

A file upload component that provides a flexible way to handle file selection, drag-and-drop functionality, and file previews. The component supports both simple button triggers and dropzone interfaces with customizable file rendering.
<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/components
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { FileUpload } from "@spark-ui/components/file-upload"

export default () => (
  <FileUpload>
    <FileUpload.Trigger>
      Upload Files
    </FileUpload.Trigger>
    <FileUpload.Context>
      {({ acceptedFiles }) => (
        <ul>
          {acceptedFiles.map((file, index) => (
            <FileUpload.AcceptedFile key={index} file={file} />
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </FileUpload.Context>
  </FileUpload>
);
```

## Callbacks

The FileUpload component provides several callback props that allow you to respond to file selection and validation events:

- **`onFileAccept`** - Called when files are accepted after validation. Receives details about the accepted files.
  ```tsx
  onFileAccept?: (details: FileAcceptDetails) => void
  
  interface FileAcceptDetails {
    files: File[]
  }
  ```

- **`onFileReject`** - Called when files are rejected due to validation errors. Receives details about the rejected files and their error codes.
  ```tsx
  onFileReject?: (details: FileRejectDetails) => void
  
  interface FileRejectDetails {
    files: RejectedFile[]
  }
  ```

- **`onFileChange`** - Called when files change (both accepted and rejected). Receives details about both accepted and rejected files. Use this for controlled mode by extracting `details.acceptedFiles` to update the `value` prop.
  ```tsx
  onFileChange?: (details: FileChangeDetails) => void
  
  interface FileChangeDetails {
    acceptedFiles: File[]
    rejectedFiles: RejectedFile[]
  }
  ```

## API Reference

### FileUpload

Contains all the parts of a file upload.

<ArgTypes of={FileUpload} />

### _.Trigger

Triggers the file selection dialog when clicked. Can be styled as a button or rendered as any component using the `asChild` prop.

<ArgTypes of={FileUpload.Trigger} />

### _.Dropzone

Provides a drag-and-drop area for file selection. Can be customized with children and supports the `unstyled` prop to remove default styling.

<ArgTypes of={FileUpload.Dropzone} />

### _.Context

A render prop component that provides access to `acceptedFiles`, `rejectedFiles`, `formatFileSize`, and `locale` from the FileUpload context.

<ArgTypes of={FileUpload.Context} />

### _.AcceptedFile

Displays an accepted file with its name, size, and a delete button. Supports upload progress display via the `uploadProgress` prop.

<ArgTypes of={FileUpload.AcceptedFile} />

### _.RejectedFile

Displays a rejected file with its name, size, error messages, and a delete button. Requires a `renderError` function to customize error message display.

<ArgTypes of={FileUpload.RejectedFile} />


## Examples

### Controlled

The FileUpload component supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes. In controlled mode, you manage the files state externally using the `value` prop and update it via the `onFileChange` callback by extracting `details.acceptedFiles`. This is useful when you need to synchronize the file list with external state management, form libraries, or when you want to programmatically control the files.

<Canvas of={stories.Controlled} />

### With default files

Use the `defaultValue` prop to initialize the component with existing files. This is useful when editing a form with previously uploaded files or when restoring files from a saved state.

<Canvas of={stories.WithDefaultFiles} />

### Single file

Use the `multiple={false}` prop to allow only a single file to be selected. When a new file is selected, it will replace the existing file.

<Canvas of={stories.SingleFile} />



### Error Handling

The FileUpload component provides comprehensive validation and error handling capabilities. You can set various constraints and handle different types of validation errors:

**Built-in Validation Props:**

- `maxFiles` - Maximum number of files allowed
- `maxFileSize` - Maximum file size in bytes
- `minFileSize` - Minimum file size in bytes
- `accept` - Allowed MIME types or file extensions

**Built-in Error Types:**

- `TOO_MANY_FILES` - Exceeds maxFiles limit
- `FILE_INVALID_TYPE` - File type not in accept list
- `FILE_TOO_LARGE` - File size exceeds maxFileSize
- `FILE_TOO_SMALL` - File size below minFileSize
- `FILE_INVALID` - Generic validation failure
- `FILE_EXISTS` - Duplicate file detected

Use `FileUpload.Context` to access `acceptedFiles` and `rejectedFiles`, then use `FileUpload.AcceptedFile` and `FileUpload.RejectedFile` components to display files with their validation errors. Each rejected file can have multiple error codes, allowing you to show all validation issues at once.

<Canvas of={stories.ErrorHandling} />

### Disabled state

Use the `disabled` prop to prevent user interaction with the file upload component. When disabled, users cannot add, remove, or modify files. The component is visually disabled with reduced opacity and a "not-allowed" cursor. Existing files are still displayed but cannot be modified. Disabled fields do not participate in form submission.

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

### Read-only state

Use the `readOnly` prop to set the file upload to read-only mode. Similar to disabled, users cannot add, remove, or modify files, but the component maintains a more subtle visual appearance (no opacity reduction). Existing files are displayed but cannot be modified. Read-only fields participate in form submission.

<Canvas of={stories.ReadOnly} />

### Upload progress

Use the `uploadProgress` prop on `FileUpload.AcceptedFile` to display a progress bar during file upload. The progress value should be between 0 and 100. The progress bar is displayed at the bottom of the file item container.

<Canvas of={stories.WithProgress} />

## Advanced examples

### Custom Trigger

Use `unstyled` on the `FileUpload.Trigger` and wrap it with a Spark UI component compatible with the `asChild` prop to render the button as a different component.

<Callout kind="warning" marginY="large">
  <p>
    a11y: It is important that the trigger remain a button (with `type="button"`) and that it is focusable and clickable.
  </p>
</Callout>

<Canvas of={stories.CustomTrigger} />

### Custom Dropzone

Customize the dropzone appearance and behavior by wrapping it with other components or modifying its content. This example demonstrates the use of sub-components such as `FileUpload.PreviewImage` to display image previews and `FileUpload.ItemDeleteTrigger` to add a delete button. You can also use `FileUpload.RejectedFileDeleteTrigger` for rejected files.

<Canvas of={stories.CustomDropzone} />

### Custom files preview

Use `FileUpload.Context` to access `acceptedFiles` and customize the markup of the files previews.

<Canvas of={stories.WithCustomFileRender} />


## Form field

When using the `FileUpload` component you might want to use it in combination with `FormField` to add a proper label, error message, etc.

### Label

Use `FormField.Label` to add a label to the file upload. The label provides visual context and can display the required indicator.

<Callout kind="info">
  **Note**: Unlike other form components, the `FormField.Label` is not automatically linked to the trigger button or dropzone via `aria-labelledby`. The accessible name of the button/dropzone remains their natural text content. The label is still useful for visual consistency, required indicators, and form structure.
</Callout>

<Canvas of={stories.FieldLabel} />

### Required

Use the `isRequired` prop of the `FormField` to indicate that the file upload is required.

<Callout kind="warning">
  If your form has mandatory fields, you must include an explicit note at the top of the form, outside of the input fields, to inform users that certain fields are required.
</Callout>

<Canvas of={stories.FieldRequired} />

### Helper message

Use the `FormField.HelperMessage` component to provide a description to the file upload.

<Canvas of={stories.FieldHelperMessage} />

### Validation

Set the `state` prop of the `FormField` to `error` to indicate that the file upload is invalid. Optionally use the `FormField.ErrorMessage` to describe why the file upload is invalid.

<Canvas of={stories.FieldInvalid} />

## Accessibility

<A11yReport of="file-upload" />

Adheres to the [file upload pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/file-upload/).

### Keyboard Interactions

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> - Navigate to the file upload trigger
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> - Open file selection dialog
- <kbd>Escape</kbd> - Close file selection dialog

### Pattern

The FileUpload component uses a context-based architecture where the main component provides file management state and the sub-components handle specific functionality like triggering file selection and displaying file previews.
