## Accessibility

<A11yReport of="progress" />

Adheres to the [progressbar WAI-ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#progressbar). There is no pattern for the progressbar.

### Guidelines

- Usage of `aria-label` or `Progress.Label` is **mandatory**. It serves as the accessible name for the progress.

- The author **SHOULD** supply values for `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and `aria-valuemax`, unless the value is indeterminate, in which case the author **SHOULD** omit the `aria-valuenow` attribute. 

- Authors **SHOULD** update these values when the visual progress indicator is updated. 

- If the progressbar is describing the loading progress of a particular region of a page, the author **SHOULD** use `aria-describedby` to point to the status, and set the `aria-busy` attribute to `true` on the region until it is finished loading. 

- It is not possible for the user to alter the value of a progressbar because it is always readonly.

### Screen reader

 - As your loading start, the focus must be forwarded to the progressbar (use a ref).
 - When the loading is finished, the focus must be forwarded to loaded region or first focusable element inside the loaded region.
