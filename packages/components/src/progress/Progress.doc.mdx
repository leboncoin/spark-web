# Progress

A progressbar indicates that the user's request has been received and the application is making progress toward completing the requested action.

<Callout kind="warning">
  <p>
    Do not use this component as a step indicator. It indicates a timed event with a beginning and an end.
  </p>
  <p>This component is also different than the <TextLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/meter/">Meter</TextLink> pattern.</p>
</Callout>


<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

## Install

```sh
npm install @spark-ui/components
```

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@spark-ui/components/progress'

export default () => <Progress />;

// Or
export default () => (
  <Progress>
    <Progress.Bar />
    <Progress.Label />
  </Progress>
);
```

## Examples

### Intent

Use `intent` prop to set the color intent of the progress.

<Canvas of={stories.Intent} />

### Shape

Use `shape` prop to set the shape of the progress.

<Canvas of={stories.Shape} />

### Label

Use `Progress.Label` component to display a label for the progress. If this component is used there is not need of passing the `aria-label` prop.

<Canvas of={stories.Label} />

### Value

Use the `value` prop to represent the current percentage of progress. The minimum and maximum values default to `0` and `100`, respectively.

<Canvas of={stories.Value} />

### Max

Use the `max` prop to set a different scale for the progress.

<Canvas of={stories.Max} />

### Value label

Use the `getValueLabel` prop to define an accessible label text representing the current value in a human-readable format. If not provided, the value label will be read as the numeric value as a percentage of the max value.

<Canvas of={stories.ValueLabel} />

### Indeterminate

Use `isIndeterminate` prop to represent an interdeterminate operation.

<Canvas of={stories.Indeterminate} />

## Advanced Examples

### Visible value

Displaying the progress value as text is possible by composing the different components.

<Canvas of={stories.VisibleValue} />

## Accessibility

<A11yReport of="progress" />

Adheres to the [progressbar WAI-ARIA role](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#progressbar). There is no pattern for the progressbar.

### Guidelines

- Usage of `aria-label` or `Progress.Label` is **mandatory**. It serves as the accessible name for the progress.

- The author **SHOULD** supply values for `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and `aria-valuemax`, unless the value is indeterminate, in which case the author **SHOULD** omit the `aria-valuenow` attribute. 

- Authors **SHOULD** update these values when the visual progress indicator is updated. 

- If the progressbar is describing the loading progress of a particular region of a page, the author **SHOULD** use `aria-describedby` to point to the status, and set the `aria-busy` attribute to `true` on the region until it is finished loading. 

- It is not possible for the user to alter the value of a progressbar because it is always readonly.

### Screen reader

 - As your loading start, the focus must be forwarded to the progressbar (use a ref).
 - When the loading is finished, the focus must be forwarded to loaded region or first focusable element inside the loaded region.
